## String Scrambler
A gibberish converter.

# Usage for existing programs
Read the instructions in Decrypt.key, and encrypt or decrypt strings by importing Decrytor into your python program, and using
Decryptor.decrypt(string) or Decryptor.encrypt(string).
These functions return strings. This is useful for existing python programs.

# Usage for fun
This program can also be used only to encrypt strings. Basically, read the encrypt usage instructions. It's format is:
python3 EncryptString.py stringToEncrypt

However, read the usage about backslashes and quotation marks.

Now for decrypting, it's simliar using DecryptString, however the encryptor may spit out a string with backslashes and/or quotes. When using variables in a python program this is not a problem, but you'll have to add backslashes as described in Encrypt_Usage.

# License
Do whatever you want with it, I don't care. Copy it, mod it, use it for whatever reason. If you are using it for a program, or a game, please give me some credit for making it, but for small projects this is optional or not needed.
